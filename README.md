React Native apps may target iOS 9.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS.

Get react-native-cli [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

Make sure to read _React Native CLI Quickstart_ NOT Expo
